# GPA Calculator

## 23rd September 2019

### **Versions of the app**

#### Version 1

Add courses without the ability to edit on the go. Each course added would be static

#### Version 2

Add courses with the ability to edit an already added course. This means that input elements would be used and new drop down list would be created everytime the add course button is clicked

```html
<div style="visibility: visible" class="course-table">
            <div class="course-table-items">
              <p class="course-name"></p>
              <p class="course-grade"></p>
              <p class="course-credits"></p>
            </div>
            <div class="remove-course">
              &cross;
            </div>
```
