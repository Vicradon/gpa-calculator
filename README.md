# gpa-calculator

Hello developer. Want to contribute to open source? Why not start from here. This project was formerly designed to work with functions only, but seeing the limitations of that approach, I decided to use classes, working with MVC architecture. 

## Project Overview

Basically, each semester is a unit, in this case, an object of the semester class. Each semester functions individually. Data from each semester would be collected and the cgpa calculated.
